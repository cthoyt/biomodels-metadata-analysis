# biomodels-metadata-analysis

[BioModels](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/) is a [CC0 licensed](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/termsofuse) repository
of mathematical models of biological and biomedical systems. It contains manually curated, non-curated, and
autogenerated models of varying quality. Most contain some model-level metadata.

This repo automatically downloads, parses, and summarizes the metadata across all applicable models
in BioModels. Currently, it generates 3 files:

1. [`tag_summary.tsv`](tag_summary.tsv) - summarizes what prefixes are used in model-level metadata
2. [`tag_prefix_summary.tsv`](tag_prefix_summary.tsv) - summarizes what prefixes are used in model-level metadata and in
   combination with what target prefixes
3. [`triples.tsv`](triples.tsv) - dump of all metadata statements as triples, normalized with
   the [Bioregistry](https://github.com/biopragmatics/bioregistry).

**Editorial**: It's pretty obvious that while there may be subtle differences between the predicates in
the http://biomodels.net/biology-qualifiers/ and http://biomodels.net/model-qualifiers/ namespaces, it appears
that there is lots of duplicated information and not a standardized schema applied across BioModels.

## Rebuild

Dependencies and analysis are automated with `tox`. Run the following in the command line:

```shell
pip install tox
tox
```
