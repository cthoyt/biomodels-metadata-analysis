# biomodels-metadata-analysis

[BioModels](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/) is a repository of mathematical models of biological and biomedical
systems. It contains manually curated, non-curated, and autogenerated models of varying quality. Most contain some
model-level metadata.

This repo automatically downloads, parses, and summarizes the metadata across all applicable models
in BioModels. Currently, it generates 3 files:

1. [`tag_summary.tsv`](tag_summary.tsv) - summarizes what prefixes are used in model-level metadata
2. [`tag_prefix_summary.tsv`](tag_prefix_summary.tsv) - summarizes what prefixes are used in model-level metadata and in
   combination with what target prefixes
3. [`triples.tsv`](triples.tsv) - dump of all metadata statements as triples, normalized with the Bioregistry.
